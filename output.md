# Data Output

Due to the compatibility problem that may exist between different text
editors in different operating systems I make the remark that in
Unix systems there  is no problem with things like line breaks or special
characters, however in Windows you must take the necessary precautions so
that When reviewing the text files there are no problems. I recommend that
when reading the data in Windows use the text editor WordPad replacing the
default Notepad.

Each subject will have a folder in which their data will be stored. The
Results text file is a fairly simple document that contains a summary
of the data obtained during the application of the test.

The other three files are cvs and contain tables in which their columns
describe by line the data obtained in the test. For example, in the
Selected Cards file, the column with the acronym P will describe whether
the subject's response was perseverance. The tables in each file are
also self-descriptive and are more relevant to edit or maintain code.

- choice index - chosen card
- criterion index - correct criterion

- FKS - Failure to keep set, meaning that after 5 hits the subject responded
incorrectly.
